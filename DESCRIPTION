Description: Estimate group-specific and observation-specific intraclass correlations (ICCs). A maximal mixed effects location scale model (MELSM) is used to predict the variance components of the ICC. Per-group and per-observation ICCs are estimated. Various ICCs are supported (e.g., unconditional, conditional, adjusted, ICC(1), ICC(2)). ICCs can be predicted across both within-group and between-group covariates. Due to the Bayesian framework, posterior intervals for the ICCs are available. Models can be compared using leave-one-out cross-validation.
